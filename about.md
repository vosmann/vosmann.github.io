I'm a software engineer living in Berlin.

After my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in computer science
I began working for a satellite software company called [Amphinicy](http://www.amphinicy.com/).
There I had a great time writing programs that orchestrate communication between earth stations 
and satellites in earth's orbit.

After a while of beaming radio waves into space with Java, I moved to Berlin and
started a new job with [Zalando](http://jobs.zalando.de/en/welcome-zalando), Europe's biggest
fashion retailer and platform. At Zalando I'm part of a team (originally tiny, now bigger)
dedicated to applying machine learning to help customers discover the products and brands
they like best instead of having customers browse through overwhelming catalogues.

At Zalando I reconnected with machine learning in an engineering-heavy role and have become 
absorbed by building resilient systems that serve tens of thousands of recommendations per second,
all coming from data-driven models implemented based on our data scientists' research.

Some of the things I like:

Java, Haskell, Bash, Scala, Cassandra, Solr, Postgres, AWS, STUPS, system architecture, performance testing.
